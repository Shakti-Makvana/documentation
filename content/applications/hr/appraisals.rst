Appraisals
==========

Odoo's *Appraisals* application is where employees are evaluated on a regular basis. Managers
appraise their employees, and employees are able to do a self assessment. Appraisals are
customizable and can be set for any kind of schedule.

Appraisals are a vital part of an organization, as it gives employees valuable feedback including
goals to work on, and skills to improve upon. These form the basis for things such as raises.
